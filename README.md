# Short Pinky Touch Typing
Advanced QWERTY touch-typing exercises for people with large hands but short pinkies.  Focusing on numbers, symbols, and brackets.

This is a NON-STANDARD fingering for QWERTY touch-typing.  It uses standard fingering for everything except the top row (where my pinkies don't reach).  I also find it more comfortable to use my middle fingers for an extra number key than what's standard - it helps spread the work more evenly between the fingers.

The exercises are progressive, adding keys and working outward over time.  They are built from a combination of standard finger-training patterns, regular expressions, and other code: HTML, Kotlin, Java, CSS, Regular Expressions...  Anything that uses these keys.

I upload this to typing.io to practice and get statistics.  I just do one lesson/day every day, starting over every few days.

I personally don't believe Colmak or Dvorak offer significant speed advantages over QUERTY.  The keys that give me the most problems are mostly in the same place in all 3 systems anyway:
"Rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether [Colmak/Dvorak] actually offer any real benefits"

Anecdotally:
"Dvorak made me faster almost entirely because it forced me to learn to touch type."
